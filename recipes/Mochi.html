    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>I've had mochi many times in restaurants and have always been fascinated by its unique combination of taste and texture; but I had absolutely no clue how it was done. I basically still don't, but regardless, this was my first attempt and I look forward to lots of criticism.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>ten small scoops vanilla ice cream</li>
        <li>½ cup sweet rice flour</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water</li>
        <li>one pinch salt</li>
        <li>two tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>one teaspoon green tea powder (matcha)</li>
        <li>one tablespoon cornstarch, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Remove and discard the top half of a cardboard egg carton. Line ten of the cups in the bottom half of the egg carton with plastic wrap. </li>

        <br>

        <li>Scoop ice cream into ten prepared egg carton cups. Cover scoops with plastic wrap and freeze until very firm, at least two hours. </li>

        <br>

        <li>Stir rice flour, water, and salt together in a microwave-safe bowl; add sugar and stir until completely smooth. Whisk green tea powder into rice flour mixture. </li>

        <br>

        <li>Cover the rice flour mixture bowl with plastic wrap; microwave for two minutes. Stir rice flour mixture, re-cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and microwave until mochi dough is thick and sticky, about one 1/2 minutes more. </li>

        <br>

        <li>Lightly dust a work surface with cornstarch. Turn mochi dough out on prepared work surface. Roll dough into a 1/8-inch thick rectangle; cut dough into ten equal squares. </li>

        <br>

        <li>Remove ice cream balls from plastic wrap. Place one ice cream ball in the center of one mochi dough square. Gather mochi dough together to cover the ice cream ball completely, pinch the edges together at the base, and cut off any excess dough. Repeat with remaining ice cream and dough squares.

        </li>
        
        <br>

        <li>Tightly cover each mochi ball in plastic wrap and place in egg carton, seam-side down. Freeze until firm, about two hours. 

        </li>
