    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This easy onigiri recipe is also fun to make! These rice balls are a staple of Japanese lunchboxes (bento). You can put almost anything in these rice balls; try substituting grilled salmon, pickled plums, beef, pork, turkey, or tuna with mayonnaise.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Four cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>Five ½ cups water, divided</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)</li>
        <li>Two sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
        <li>Two tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. Combine washed rice and four 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until water is absorbed, fiveteen to twenty minutes. Let rice rest for fiveteen minutes to continue to steam and become tender. Allow cooked rice to cool. </li>

        <br>

        <li>Combine remaining one cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen hands before handling rice. Divide cooked rice into eight equal portions. Use one portion of rice for each onigiri. </li>

        <br>

        <li>Divide one portion of rice in two. Create a dimple in rice and fill with a heaping teaspoon of bonito flakes. Cover with remaining portion of rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball. Gently press rice to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining portions of rice. </li>
    </ol>
